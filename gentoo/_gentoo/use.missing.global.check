build - !!internal use only!! DO NOT SET THIS FLAG YOURSELF!, used for creating build images and the first half of bootstrapping [make stage1]
custom-cflags - Build with user-specified CFLAGS (unsupported)
livecd - !!internal use only!! DO NOT SET THIS FLAG YOURSELF!, used during livecd building
prefix - Defines if a Gentoo Prefix offset installation is used
strip - Allow symbol stripping to be performed by the ebuild for special files
test - Enable dependencies and/or preparations necessary to run tests (usually controlled by FEATURES=test but can be toggled independently)
test-rust - Enable important test dependencies that require Rust toolchain
time64 - Use 64-bit time_t type instead of the regular 32-bit type. This flag is forced on time64 profiles, and masked elsewhere. It should be only used when detection of type width is not possible (e.g. for SRC_URI)
vanilla - Do not add extra patches which change default behaviour; DO NOT USE THIS ON A GLOBAL SCALE as the severity of the meaning changes drastically
